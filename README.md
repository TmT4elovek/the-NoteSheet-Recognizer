## Short description

The Notes is a web application that uses a neural network to automatically recognize sheet music and play it back in MP3 format. The project aims to simplify the process of converting traditional sheet music into digital format, which can be useful for musicians, music teachers, software developers and people with visual problems. Key components include a neural network for recognizing musical symbols, a module for converting notes to MP3, and a user-friendly graphical interface.
